# DataStructure-_-priority-_C
ok in this project i was given some funtion to do a particullar work on that , so the first function was openning the counter , but before when i was doing that first i did the two othere function which was calculating of the counter desk people and 2nd calculating all the desk member , so in that fucntion "calculeaza_numar_oameni_ghisee" i have creat loca variable intiliaz to 0 then i check first if my counter are not close or null then the loop will run and will check every person avilabilty and will print the number of peope on desk, and the 2nd is also quite simple like that but little wast then first there i use in loop the countghies static globel varibale which is store my counters number and it will count all the counters people, know back to first function at that i have creat and array of dubly linkedlist which will control of the deskcounters and will make open the counter for it if we had already the open counter then i have did the code to make divide every person to the respectivly counters, in the next fucntion was inserting the people to respectivly counter but in such case where the high priorites first if i found the two priorites same then i sorted by the name and also for this case i use some of the string builten functions also to make my work esay all the work i did in this fucntion loops+condations to make sort the prople in the lines. and so on the deletion function i did same what i have work and learn from the lab and curs not new methods on those function ,  and yeah that is all :)
